# BUS-STOP-SIMUlATION
Bus stop simulation is an open GL computer graphics project using open GL function it is a user interactive program where in the 
user can view the required display by making use of the input devices like keyboard and mouse. 
These computer graphic project mainly consists of human and bus. 
The man made to sit on the bus, so that it looks like a man is travelling in the bus the bus is moved by using keyboard or mouse It
is a computer graphics project made using visual studio.in these project it shows about bus stop. 
In this post I am going to show the open GL code on bus stop using the computer graphics and Open GL API.
There is a bus stop where the bus pics up a girl and moves her to the college gate
The problem here is that after moving the bus to the parking plotted us not end the animation.
we need to end the window manually .
